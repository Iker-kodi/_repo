- While in the wall view (Thumbnail view), the KODI sidebar can now be opened again by going all left. 
I had this disabled because i want to be able to jump to the most right object by going all left. Some ppl may have a dedicated key for the KODI sidebar on a remote. -> SetFocus(9000) (remote.xml)

- Initial Release based on Confluence 2.7.4
